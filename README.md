# As of right now, this repo will only contain a csv with every Arcaea chart available. 
I will try my best to keep it updated as updates come and chart constants are verified.

# Future(heh) plans:
[ ] Add Basic Searching Program with python
[ ] Scoring Predictions (figure out your score based on miss, far, etc.)
[ ] Play Rating Calculator
[ ] Import scores (manual b50 or specific charts)
[ ] Local list of charts (like arcade-songs.zetaraku.dev)
[ ] actual website?

This is the first project i'm putting out there properly and I'm really hoping it goes well coding gods go easy on me ;_;
