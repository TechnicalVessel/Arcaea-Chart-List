# As of right now, this repo will only contain a csv with every Arcaea chart available. All info is publicly available on the Arcaea Miraheze.
I will try my best to keep the list updated as updates come and chart constants are verified.

# Future(heh) plans:
[ ] Add Basic Searching Program with pandas

[ ] Scoring Predictions (figure out your score based on miss, far, etc.)

[ ] Play Rating Calculator

[ ] Import scores (manual b50 or specific charts)

[ ] Local list of charts (like arcade-songs.zetaraku.dev)

[ ] actual website?

This is the first project i'm putting out there properly and I'm really hoping it goes well coding gods go easy on me ;_;
