# As of right now, this repo will only contain a csv with every Arcaea chart available. All info is publicly available on the Arcaea Miraheze.
I will try my best to keep the list updated as updates come and chart constants are verified.

# This project requires pandas and keyboard
pandas is basically what makes everything possible :shrug:
keyboard is used for the scoring system

# Future(heh) plans:
[x] Add Basic Searching Program with pandas
> That was not basic '-_-

Basically I made a class with the original list and a filtered list, and used typing and pandas to take specific charts based on specific criteria (Chart Constant, Name, etc.) and add that to the filtered list.

[x] Scoring Predictions (figure out your score based on miss, and pure)
